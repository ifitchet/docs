Some introductory words.

A footnote[^1] of multiple lines before a second[^two].

[^1]: Line 1 is really quite lone to test that this really is the first line of the footnote and that the second line of the footnote really is a second line and not just tacked on the end of this one.

      Line 2

[^two]: The other footnote.
